# Brain Scaffold Builder configurations

This folder contains configuration files for cerebellar reconstruction and simulation with BSB v4.

These configurations files are split in sub-folder according to their respective specie. Each 
sub-folder will also contain a README to explain the parameters of the configuration files (i,e.: 
their rationale and sources) as well as their extensions. 

By default, the default configuration is limited to the reconstruction of the circuit with BSB.
Extensions include the parameters to simulate the circuit, distributed according to the different 
simulators when available.
