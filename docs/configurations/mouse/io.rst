Inferior olivary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The inferior olive is a nucleus in the brainstem with neurons that exhibit continuous sub-threshold activity.
It provides one of the two main inputs to the cerebellum: the so-called climbing fibers. Activation of these climbing
fibers is generally thought to be involved in the timing of motor commands and/or motor learning. Climbing fiber
activation triggers large all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which override any ongoing
activity and temporarily silence the cells. Empirical evidence indicates that climbing fibers can transmit a short burst
of spikes following an olivary cell somatic spike, potentially increasing the amount of information transferred to the
cerebellum with each activation [#de_gruijl_2012]_.
The default configuration with IO is implemented in `dcn_io.yaml <https://github.com/dbbs-lab/cerebellum/blob/feature/dcn-io/configurations/mouse/dcn-io/dcn_io.yaml>`_.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In `dcn_io.yaml <https://github.com/dbbs-lab/cerebellum/blob/feature/dcn-io/configurations/mouse/dcn-io/dcn_io.yaml>`_ , a new region called ``inferior_olivary`` was added to the ``canonical circuit + DCN``
(see `dcn.yaml <https://github.com/dbbs-lab/cerebellum/blob/feature/dcn-io/configurations/mouse/dcn-io/dcn.yaml>`_ for more microcircuital info).
This region was defined of type ``group`` because in it there is only the ``io layer``. ``io layer`` has a thickness of ``200 Âµm`` .
Additionally, in order to ensure that ``inferior_olivary`` are placed under the ``cerebellar_nuclei``, the ``origin``
of the ``dcn_layer`` was set to ``[0,0,200]`` and the ``origin`` of the ``granular_layer`` was updated to ``[0,0,400]``.

Cell types
++++++++++
No morphologies are currently available for inferior olivary (IO) neurons, so they are represented only by their soma.
We considered a single population of IO neurons.
The number of IO neurons to be placed is estimated based on the ratio between the number of Purkinje cells and
IO itself, which is reported to be ``5:1`` in Blatt and Eisenman [#blatt_1985]_.

Placement
+++++++++
IO neurons are assumed to be uniformly distributed in their own layer, hence the bsb ``RandomPlacement`` strategy is
chosen to place them.

Connectivity
++++++++++++
