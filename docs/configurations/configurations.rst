Circuit configurations
======================

The ``configurations`` folder contains configuration files for cerebellar reconstruction and
simulation with BSB v4.

These configurations files are split in sub-folder according to their respective specie. Each
sub-folder will also contain documentation to explain the parameters of the configuration files
(i,e.: their rationale and sources) as well as their extensions.

By default, the standard configuration is limited to the reconstruction of the circuit with BSB.
Extensions including the parameters to simulate the circuit, distributed according to the different
simulators, will be added when available.

The following is the list of the species for which canonical configurations have been implemented.
