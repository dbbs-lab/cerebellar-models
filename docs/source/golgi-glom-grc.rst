Golgi, glomerulus \& granule cell axis
======================================

Glomerulus
----------

* Each glomerulus must be connected exactly 1 Golgi cell. :sup:`[ref?]`

Golgi cell
----------

.. note::

  The Golgi to glomerulus connection is an intermediate for the Golgi to granule. These
  connections needn't actually be stored.

* Target a number of glomeruli according to their divergence of 40. :sup:`[ref?]`

  * A possible improvement is to make the divergence a distribution. :sup:`[data?]`

* Targets must be located within a y-axis aligned cylinder of radius 160 around the
  Golgi cell, and beneath its soma. :sup:`[ref?]`

* The Golgi cell must be connected to all the granule cells contacted by that glomerulus.
  :sup:`[ref?]`

Granule cell
------------

* The granule cell must be connected to glomeruli that originate from different mossy
  fibers. :sup:`[ref?]`
