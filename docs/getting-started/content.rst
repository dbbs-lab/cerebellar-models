This section deals with the content of the cerebellum repository.

Morphologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cerebellar cortex neuron morphology reconstructions used in our microcircuits are stored in the
``morphologies`` folder.

You can learn more details about neuron morpholgies in :doc:`this section </configurations/morphologies>`.

BSB configuration files for the cerebellar cortex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The BSB configurations are stored in the ``configurations`` folder. Sub-folders within
``configurations`` corresponds to different species reconstructions. Each specie should have its
default configuration to reconstruct the models as well as ``extensions`` that can be added to the
configuration. This includes the different simulation' paradigms.

You can now head over to the :doc:`Building a first circuit section <getting-started>`
