Cerebellum
==========

This repository provides the code, configuration and morphology data to reconstruct and simulate
cerebellar cortex circuits using the `Brain Scaffold Builder <https://bsb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
These models are based on the iterative work of the `Department of Brain and Behavioral
Sciences <https://dbbs.dip.unipv.it/en>`_ of the University of Pavia.
